        <h2 class="h4">Our Story</h2>
        <p>
            Pickle Polona began {{ years_since }} year{{ 's' if years_since != 1 else '' }} ago as a small passion project in our garden and home kitchen. What started as a love for preserving seasonal vegetables grew into a mission to share wholesome, flavorful jars with our community.
        </p>
        <p>
            Each jar reflects our belief in simple, sustainable living — using what we grow, supporting local, and making everything by hand, one batch at a time.
