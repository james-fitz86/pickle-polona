            <p>
                Pickle Polona began {{ years_since }} year{{ 's' if years_since != 1 else '' }} ago as a 
                small passion project in our garden and home kitchen. What started as a love for preserving 
                seasonal vegetables grew into a mission to share wholesome, flavourful jars with our community.
            </p>
            <p>
                Each jar reflects our belief in simple, sustainable living — using what we grow, supporting 
                local, and making everything by hand, one batch at a time.

                Every batch is made with care, inspired by the seasons and nurtured by hand. From 
                early morning garden harvests to late-night labeling sessions, you're supporting 
                more than a product — you're joining a story of love, patience, and purpose.
